   // @dc:^description "Thermal refers to the study of temperature differentials and heat flows, head can flow in 3 ways: conduction, convection, and radiation."
	// not sure why "Thermal" is being defined as a concept

   // @dc:^description  "thermal loads: these are the heat flows that we apply to the object,
						//thermal loads can be characterized as either steady state (meaning it doesn't change with time) 
						//and transient (meaning that it changes with time)."

    concept ThermalLoads :> ThermalAnalysis
   // @dc:^description "Thermoelastic pointing deviation: this is specific to the geometry of the optical tracker 
						//but if we take a line and draw it along the central axis of the optical cone, 
						//we're essentially measuring how the angle of that line changes before and 
						//after we apply the thermal loads. We want to keep this deviation as small as possible ( <0.001 degrees)"
						
    @rdfs:label "Thermoelastic Pointing Deviation"
    concept ThermoelasticPointingDev :> ThermalAnalysis
   // @dc:^description "Heat loss: it is about a heat flow.The heat loss we'll be dealing with will come in the form of radiation since we're in space, 
						//and there's no other pathway for the thermal energy to take. 
						//Heat loss is directional, meaning that if systems can gain or lose heat, this is an example of a system losing heat. 
						//Our tracker will lose heat when it passes through the shadow of the earth during orbit. 
						//Heat loss is characterized by a drop in temperature in the system."
